// you will be given a random string of letters and tasked with returning them as a string of comma-separated sequences sorted alphabetically, with each sequence starting with an uppercase character followed by n-1 lowercase characters, where n is the letter's alphabet position 1-26.

// Example
// alphaSeq("ZpglnRxqenU") -> "Eeeee,Ggggggg,Llllllllllll,Nnnnnnnnnnnnnn,Nnnnnnnnnnnnnn,Pppppppppppppppp,Qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq,Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr,Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu,Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
// Technical Details
// The string will include only letters.
// The first letter of each sequence is uppercase followed by n-1 lowercase.
// Each sequence is separated with a comma.
// Return value needs to be a string.
